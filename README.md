# Evolutionary computation | Evolutionary Strategies Benchmark for CEM, NES and CMA-ES

The scope of this project is to implement and test three different evolutionary strategies (Cross-Entropy Method (CEM),  Natural Evolution Strategy (NES), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)) on two different convex functions (a sphere function and a 2-dimensional Rastrigin function)  to further explore their capabilities.

This repository also provides three videos in which is possible to see some quick demo examples of the 3 algorithms running on the Sphere function.
